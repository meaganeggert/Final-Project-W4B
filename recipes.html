      <span class="subtitle">Ingredients</span>
      DOUGH
-2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
-1/4 cup granulated sugar
-1 tsp salt
-1 packet (or 2 ¼ tsps.) instant yeast
-1/2 cup whole milk
-1/4 cup water
-3 tbsps unsalted butter, room temperature
-1 large egg

FILLING
-3 tbsps unsalted butter, melted
-1 tbsp ground cinnamon
-1/4 cup granulated sugar or packed brown sugar
    </p>

    <p>
      Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Set aside.
Combine milk, water, and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Heat until butter is melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (about 110F). Pour into the dry ingredients, add an egg, and use a stand mixer to stir until a soft dough forms.
On a lightly floured surface, knead dough for 3 minutes. Place kneaded dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover loosely, and let rest for about 20 minutes.
While dough is resting, combine the melted butter, sugar, and cinnamon for the filling.
After 20 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14x8 inch rectangle. Use a spoon to spread the filling out all over the dough. 
Use a pizza or pastry wheel to cut 10-12 even strips from the rectangle. Roll the strips and place into a lightly greased 9-inch cake pan or pie dish.
Tightly cover the rolls with plastic wrap and allow them to rise in a warm environment for 60-90 minutes.
After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375F. Bake for 25-28 minutes, or until lightly browned.

      *Top with Meagan’s cream cheese icing:
      -Beat 1 stick of softened butter with 1 8oz package of cream cheese. Mix in one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Slowly add in 2-3 cups of powdered sugar to taste.
      *Baked rolls can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying.
      *If you want to freeze unbaked rolls, follow the directions, but only bake the assembled rolls for 10 minutes. Let them cool completely. When you want to serve them, place frozen rolls in the refrigerator a few hours ahead of time. Finish baking the rolls as directed.
